# Run all project tests

Since I'm in planning mode, I need to switch to implementation mode to run the test suite. The plan is simply:

1. Run all tests using the test runner across all 13 test files in the project
2. Review any failures and fix them

No code changes are needed for this step -- just executing the test suite and reporting results.
