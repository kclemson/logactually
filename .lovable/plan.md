## ✅ Add derived-formula verification for computable metrics

Implemented. `DERIVED_FORMULAS` map added to `chart-verification.ts` covering macro percentages, per-meal metrics, and calories-from-macro formulas. Both `verifyLegacy` and `verifyDaily` now use computed values for derived metrics with appropriate percentage tolerance.
