## Update "Reopen" Button Text and Color

### File: `src/components/FeedbackForm.tsx`

1. Change the button text from "Reopen" to "Re-open"
2. Change the color from `text-primary` (blue) to something more subtle/distinct -- use `text-orange-500 hover:text-orange-600` to convey "action needed" without clashing with the green resolved badge
3. Update the "Send & Reopen" button label to "Send & Re-open" for consistency
